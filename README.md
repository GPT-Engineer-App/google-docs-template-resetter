# google-docs-template-resetter

The script is intended to reset a Google Docs template and populate a table with data, applying specific styles and configurations. It starts by checking if the document is empty and resets it by clearing existing content and setting up a new table based on the provided dimensions and preferences. The table is populated with placeholders, which are later replaced with actual data. The script also includes functions for updating table cell styles, copying elements from one cell to another, handling data merge operations, and more. However, there's an issue where only the first grid object is populated correctly, and subsequent ones are not.
